Description: A simple wrapper for calculating regression weights as defined by Aronow and 
    Samii (2015) <doi:10.1111/ajps.12185>. Given a model object and a term of
    interest, 'regweight' will calculate implicit regression weights and provide a variety of useful
    visualizations and summary statistics.
